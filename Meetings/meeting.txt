Status:
Good for controller setup/architecture
Need real robot for testing with force
Start considering what we actually want to do for the demonstration:
	
How do we combine human motion with force contact area.
Contact area should not be used in the learning. We get forces from learning, then combine contact area with it.
When teaching only the trajectory should be demonstrated. The contact pressure should be made constant and force should be estimate for entire trajectory.
Look up force vs material removal.
Need access to I4.0 lab.
The story of the project is important. Why we did it -> how we did it -> results -> future work (edge cases, generalization)
Could compare force controller with contact pressure controller to show contact pressure controller is better.
When the controller is following the force it should follow the filtered force.

For next meeting we look at the big picture. Have a few slides of presentation ready. What is our story?
