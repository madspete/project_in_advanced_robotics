Plan:

Week 1:
Research topics
- DONE

Week 2 (28/2-06/03):
Figure out who works on what and start development
Jens - Point clouds for data generation
Mads - LfD possibly SEDS/GMM - DONE
Marcus - Hybrid force/position controller
Each is researching/searching for background knowledge in their respective task
- DONE

Week 3 (07/03-13/03):
Jens - Figured out how to sample a point cloud form and object, and import it into MATLAB
Mads - LfD for force setimation is now running (Input is time for now)
Marucs - ?

Week 4 (14/03-20/03):
Jens - Implementation of force estimation over a surface using formulas from papers -> continues next week
Mads - Implemented hybrid force-position controller similar to the one in  the paper. Issues with the Inverse kinematics

Week 5 (21/03-27/03):
Mads - Figure out issue with invers kinematics
Jens - Continue development of force estimation. Maybe look into adding noise to signal and making a filter for it (What does Yiatek recommend? Does it make sense to do once we have the hardware?)

Week 6 (28/03-03/04):
Goal: Have simulation running
